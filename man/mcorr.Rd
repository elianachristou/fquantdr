\title{Multiple correlation}
\usage{
mcorr(u, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{u, v}{Numeric vectors or matrices.}
}
\value{
\code{mcorr} computes the multiple correlation between \code{u}
and \code{v}.
}
\description{
\code{mcorr} computes the multiple correlation between two vectors or
matrices \code{u} and \code{v}.
}
\details{
This function computes the multiple correlation between two vectors or
matrices \code{u} and \code{v} of the same dimension.  Let \eqn{C_{uu}},
\eqn{C_{uv}}, and \eqn{C_{vu}} represent the sample covariance matrices.
The multiple correlation between \code{u} and \code{v} is given by:
\deqn{
mcorr(u, v) = tr(C_{vv}^{-1/2} C_{vu} C_{uu}^{-1} C_{uv} C_{vv}^{-1/2}).
}
This number ranges from 0 to d, the dimension of \code{u} and \code{v},
where a number closer to d indicates stronger correlation.  This measure
was used, for example, in Li and Song (2022) and Solea et al. (2024).

\examples{
# Example 1
u <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 2)
v <- u + 0.1 * matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 2)
mcorr(u, v)

# Example 2
u <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 3)
v <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 3)
mcorr(u, v)
